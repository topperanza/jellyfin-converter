# Jellyfin Converter v1.1.0 Release Notes

## Overview
Jellyfin Converter v1.1.0 introduces smarter scanning defaults (ignoring hidden files and output directories), improves robustness for files with missing language metadata, and solidifies the development environment with `shellcheck-py`.

## Highlights
- **Smarter Scanning**: The scan now automatically skips hidden directories (like `.git`, `.trash`) and the configured output directory to prevent re-processing or loops.
- **Robust Metadata Handling**: Subtitle tracks with empty or missing language tags are now safely normalized to `und` (undetermined) instead of causing validation errors.
- **DevEx**: Switched to `shellcheck-py` for consistent, reproducible linting across all environments (macOS/Linux) without relying on system package managers.

## Upgrade Notes
- No breaking changes.
- Existing commands will work as before, but scanning large directories should be faster and safer due to the new exclusion rules.
