# Jellyfin Converter v1.0.0 Release Notes

## Overview
Jellyfin Converter v1.0.0 packages a safe, deterministic MKV remux/transcode pipeline focused on macOS portability and conservative defaults. This release emphasizes predictable subtitle handling, strict sidecar discovery, and CI coverage across macOS and Ubuntu using `shellcheck-py` (no Homebrew required).

## Highlights
- Deterministic subtitle selection with stable ranking to avoid drift across runs.
- Forced/default subtitle disposition propagation to preserve intended playback cues.
- Strict sidecar anchoring rules to prevent misattribution of external subtitles to the wrong source file.
- CI on macOS and Ubuntu via `shellcheck-py`.

## Compatibility
- Requires Bash 3.2+ (tested on macOS system Bash).
- Requires `ffmpeg` and `ffprobe` available on `PATH` (obtain binaries separately; not bundled).

## Subtitle Policy (practical)
- Keeps English/Italian and commentary tracks; one normal + one forced per allowed language when available.
- Prefers external text subtitles (e.g., `.srt`) over internal bitmap subtitles; bitmap retention controlled by `KEEP_BITMAP_SUBS`.
- Sidecars must strictly match the video stem; suffixes must include a recognized tag (language/forced/SDH/commentary) to be accepted.

## Known Limitations
- No bundled `ffmpeg`/`ffprobe`; environments must supply binaries.
- Current scan traverses all subdirectories; exclude hidden/backup paths manually.
- External bitmap sidecars (`.sup`, `.idx`+`.sub`) require `KEEP_BITMAP_SUBS=1`.

## What’s Next (v1.0.x)
- Harden ffprobe parsing and reduce subprocess overhead.
- Exclude output/hidden paths from scans to avoid reprocessing.
- Safer sidecar deletion controls and clearer commentary labeling.
- Bash 3.2 compatibility gate in CI plus explicit ffmpeg/ffprobe installs.
